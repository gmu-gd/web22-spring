<p>Recreate a Joseph MÃ¼ller-Brockmann poster (<a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/4154#works">MoMA</a>, <a href="http://www.artnet.com/artists/josef-m%C3%BCller-brockmann/">artnet</a>, <a href="https://www.grapheine.com/en/history-of-graphic-design/graphic-designer-muller-brockmann-swiss-style">Grapheine</a>, <a href="https://www.internationalposter.com/exhibitions/mid-century-modern-the-posters-of-josef-muller-brockmann/">International Poster Gallery</a>, or you can download some images <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/93mz3dqum2kckik/AACvG4Y57cacxn6UcN-OYwsTa?dl=0">here</a>) as accurately as you can in Illustrator (1080x1920) and then animate it in After Effects. The posters are generally in German so you might not be able to read all the content but I would try to find out what kind of event the poster is promoting. Knowing the event might influence the motion of the poster. Your animation should enhance and bring the poster to life. More than likely the font is Akzidenz Grotesk.</p>

<h5 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>1080x1920 (or dimensions close to that but keep the proportions of the original poster)</li>
  <li>As long as it needs to be</li>
  <li>As exact of a replica as you can make</li>
  <li>Only animate things that already exist on the poster</li>
</ul>
