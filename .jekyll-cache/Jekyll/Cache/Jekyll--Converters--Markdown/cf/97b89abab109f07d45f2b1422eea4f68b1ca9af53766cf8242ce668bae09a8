<p>Make a realistic ball bounce around the screen in a designed setting (look up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDqjIdI4bF4&amp;t=254s">staging</a> in the 12 principles of animation). The ball should pretend to exist somewhat as a real object and either use the sides of the frame as walls or the frame should move with the ball. Motions and physics can be exaggerated.</p>
