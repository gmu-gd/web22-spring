<p>Final poster printed on Heavy Weight Coated (HW Coated) paper from <a href="https://art.gmu.edu/facilities/soaprint/prices/">SoA Print Studio</a> and trimmed to the correct size. I believe the print should cost around $14.40 give or take a dollar. If it costs more than that check to make sure you are printing to the correct paper. Donâ€™t forget to <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/printers-marks-bleeds.html">include crop marks and the bleed</a> on the PDF you send to print. <a href="/projects/p2">Full Description</a></p>
