<p>This exercise is focused on collage as a medium and a process. In its most basic form, collage is cut and torn paper—typically sourced from magazines, advertising, packaging, novels or old textbooks—glued onto a flat substrate.</p>

<p>You will create 5 collages working quickly and intuitively. Vary the way you are working and try different ideas with each collage. If you find yourself getting stuck trying to put too much meaning into one collage, work abstractly in the next one. If you find yourself focusing too much on the images and words you are using, flip the piece over once you cut it out and see what is on the back.</p>

<p>Each collage should be on its own sheet of paper and be 6″x9″ when cropped down. The final collages will need to be scanned for documentation.</p>
