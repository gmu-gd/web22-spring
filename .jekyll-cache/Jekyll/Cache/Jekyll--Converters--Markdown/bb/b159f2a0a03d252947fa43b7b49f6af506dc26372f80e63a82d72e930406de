<p>Pick a cause you feel passionate about and make a poster that you would carry at a rally for that cause or post on a wall. The design should be simple enough to be made from a cut paper stencil and have a clear message. It can have multiple layers but each layer will need to have a stencil, so keep in mind the labor of making before committing to a complicated design.</p>
