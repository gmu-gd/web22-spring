I"~	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>An investigation into typography as a means of communication and as a formal element in design. The poster can only contain type and the image(s) of your physically constructed letter. The content of the poster should relate to your chosen letter.</p>

<h3 id="part-one-choose-and-build-your-letter">Part One: Choose and Build Your Letter</h3>
<p>Choose a single letter and generate a list of 20 words that start with your letter. Using your word list as a reference point, pick a typeface (<a href="https://gmu-gd.github.io/classes/type/index.html">some foundries with free trial fonts</a>) and construct your letter at a minimum of 6 inches tall using the typeface as a guide. Once your letter is constructed take at least five different photographs of it. The photographs should just have your letter in them, no other items.</p>

<h3 id="part-two-design-the-poster">Part Two: Design the Poster</h3>
<p>Design a poster using at least one of the photographs of your letter and any other text based content you might choose to include. The poster is generally a formal study so pay attention to the basic design principles of alignment, balance, color, contrast, hierarchy, proximity, repetition, space, and so on.</p>
