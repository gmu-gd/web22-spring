<p>Choose a word and create an animation that reinforces the wordâ€™s meaning. Do this for a total of 3 words. The file does not have to loop seamlessly but can if it makes sense. Use Futura Bold for setting your words.</p>

<ul>
  <li>transition</li>
  <li>expansion</li>
  <li>migration</li>
  <li>elimination</li>
  <li>repetition</li>
  <li>compression</li>
  <li>disruption</li>
  <li>silence</li>
  <li>softness</li>
  <li>loudness</li>
  <li>heavy</li>
  <li>lightness</li>
  <li>addition</li>
  <li>subtraction</li>
  <li>movement</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have your three different words, assign each word to one of the methods of creating your animations below. Your final output should be three different animations that are around 1 second each. Each animation should be a different word and use a different method of creation.</p>

<p>METHOD 1 Make an animation in Photoshop as an around 30 frame (or more) gif but export it as a video (export &gt; render video).
METHOD 2 Make an animation entirely in After Effects using the transform properties and should be around a 1 second movie.
METHOD 3 Make an animation physically using your phone or other video camera. This should also be around 1 second long.</p>
