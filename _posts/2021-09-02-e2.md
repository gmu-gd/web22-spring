#### Exercise 2: Type Effects
The computer isn't the only tool we have to manipulate type. Sometimes physical manipulations can create forms that might be impossible to create on the computer.

Print out five phrases in black text on a white background on a letter sized sheet of paper and bring them to class on 9/9. In class we will trade with each other and make physical manipulations to each phrase. Bring supplies that could be useful for you to work in class (sample list below). Final submissions will be your five manipulations  brought back into the computer through scanning or photography, printed back out in black and white, and added on Miro.

##### Potential Materials
* scissors / cutting knife
* cutting matt / ruler
* glue / tape
* camera / iPhone
* marker / pen / ink / paint
* printer acetate
* construction paper
* foam core / matt board
* etc.

##### Requirements
* 5 black and white phrases
* Each phrase printed on landscape, letter sized paper
