#### Exercise 4: New Views
Formally speaking, abstract photography is a method of expressing ideas and emotions without the intention of creating a traditional or realistic image. By avoiding and going beyond the usual representations of an object, scene, or any particular element, it reveals details that are normally ignored and triggers the viewerâ€™s imagination.

Take at least 50 abstract photographs of the world around you, focusing on things like simplicity, composition, angle of view, lighting, harmony, and mystery. Photograph an array of subjects indoor and out but do not get stuck on a single subject. Remember that these will be used for a portrait poster so don't take every image in a landscape format.

Print the ten images you find most compelling and bring them to class. They can be individual prints or combined (but large enough to see) onto one or two sheets but they do not need to be photographic prints. A laser print is fine.

##### Requirements
* 50 photographs
* 10 printed for class
* 10 images added to Miro
