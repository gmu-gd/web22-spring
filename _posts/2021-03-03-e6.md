#### Exercise 6: Bouncing Ball
Make a realistic ball bounce around the screen in a designed setting (look up [staging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDqjIdI4bF4&t=254s) in the 12 principles of animation). The ball should pretend to exist somewhat as a real object and either use the sides of the frame as walls or the frame should move with the ball. Motions and physics can be exaggerated.


##### Technical Requirements
* 1920x1080
* Somewhere between 5 and 15 seconds
* Ball interacts with the edge of the frame or the frame moves with the ball
* Designed setting for the ball to exist in
