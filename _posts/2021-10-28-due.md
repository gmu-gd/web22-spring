#### P2 final
Final poster printed on Heavy Weight Coated (HW Coated) paper from [SoA Print Studio](https://art.gmu.edu/facilities/soaprint/prices/) and trimmed to the correct size. I believe the print should cost around $14.40 give or take a dollar. If it costs more than that check to make sure you are printing to the correct paper. Don't forget to [include crop marks and the bleed](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/printers-marks-bleeds.html) on the PDF you send to print. [Full Description]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/p2)

#### P3.2: Checkpoint 2
Two different digital drafts, printed in color (if necessary) on tabloid sized paper (scaled to fit) and trimmed to size. Drafts added to Miro. [Full Description]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/p3)
