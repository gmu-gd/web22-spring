#### Exercise 5:
5 6&#8243;x9&#8243; collages and scans or good photographs of them added to Miro. [Full Description]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#e5)

#### P1 Final
Final poster printed on Heavy Weight Coated (HW Coated) paper from [SoA Print Studio](https://art.gmu.edu/facilities/soaprint/prices/) and trimmed to the correct size. I believe the print should cost around $14.40 give or take a dollar. If it costs more than that check to make sure you are printing to the correct paper. Don't forget to [include crop marks and the bleed](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/printers-marks-bleeds.html) on the PDF you send to print. [Full Description]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/p1)

#### P2.1: Checkpoint 1
Ten photos from e4 and five collages from e5 brought to class (can always be more). Photos and collages added to Miro. [Full Description]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/p2)

#### R2: _The Persistence of Posters_
Read the essay and add something you thought was interesting to Miro. [Link to Reading](https://walkerart.org/magazine/the-persistence-of-posters)
